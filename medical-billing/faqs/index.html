            <a class="acc-faq">Is there a cost to enroll or to process claims through the portal?</a>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>No, there is no cost to the physician to enroll or to process claims through Vaccine Manager.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a class="acc-faq">Can I enroll multiple practice locations (sites) under one account?</a>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Yes. Vaccine Manager supports many business configurations.
              <br><br>
              The simplest configuration is an Account with one location. This Account can be enrolled with one Site. Billing and payment information can be entered either at the Account level.
              <br><br>
              For Accounts that have multiple locations (Sites), all Sites should be entered as part of the one Account enrollment process. First enter the central Account information and then Vaccine Manager will ask you to enter information for each of the Sites. If all billing is done centrally at the Account level using one Tax ID/NPI then enter that information in the Account form. If billing is done at a Site level under separate Tax ID/NPI numbers then enter that information at the Site level.
              <br><br>
              Payments can be configured to be sent to one central bank account or address or can be sent to individual Sites.</p>

             <a class="acc-faq">Do all physicians within the practice have to participate?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>No: Enrollment can be limited to physicians who want to participate.</p>
             </div>
           </div>
           <div class="accordion-item">
             <a class="acc-faq">If physicians within the practice have a different TAX ID, do they need to enroll separately?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>Yes: Physicians practicing out of the same location, but who are paid under a different TAX ID are recognized as separate entities for enrollment and payment purposes. A separate Site enrollment is required for each TAX ID that will be used to submit claims.</p>

           <div class="accordion-item">
             <a class="acc-faq">Can I get paid directly through an ACH transaction?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>It is easy to enter your bank account information during the enrollment process so that payments can be made directly to your bank account. If desired payments can be made via check. There is a nominal charge of $2.50 for payment by check. There is no charge for payments submitted by ACH.</p>

           <div class="accordion-item">
             <a class="acc-faq">Do I need an NPI?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>Yes. Under the NPI Final Rule (69 FR 3434), a health care provider who is a covered entity under HIPAA is required to obtain an NPI and to use it to identify itself as a health care provider in HIPAA transactions no later than May 23, 2007. Small health plans must use the NPI no later than May 23, 2008. A health care provider is a covered entity if it transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which the Secretary has adopted a standard (Redundant to above). For example, any health care provider (individual or organization) who sends electronic health care claims to a health plan(s),is a covered provider and must obtain an NPI. Health care providers who are not covered providers may elect to apply for NPIs, but are not required to do so. For the latest information regarding NPI issues for health care providers, visit this website: <a href="www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalProvIdentStand/">www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalProvIdentStand/</a></p>

             <a class="acc-faq">What if I am not a contracted provider for some of the plans Vaccine Manager is contract with?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>You do not need to be contracted with all of the plans Vaccine Manager is contracted with. It is possible that your patients Part D coverage is with a different insurance provider than their medical coverage. If Vaccine Manager is contracted with that plan, you are considered a contracted provider for vaccines covered by Part D benefits.</p>

             <a class="acc-faq">Is there a cost to participate in the Vaccine Manager network?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>There are no billed charges to the physician. Costs are calculated into the vaccine reimbursement rates. There is a nominal $2.50 fee for the printing and mailing of remittance checks if you do not elect ACH transfers (direct deposit to your bank account).</p>

             <div class="answer">
               <p>No: The contract terms and conditions are tied to the terms and conditions we have with third party payers. Changes to the provider contract would violate these terms.</p>

               <p>No: The information captured online during the enrollment process is validated based on the information entered. There is no need to submit further hard copies of this information.

             <a class="acc-faq">How often will I get paid for submitted claims?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>As with medical professional fees, reimbursement varies by plan. The amount you will receive for each vaccine is displayed when you submit a Coverage Inquiry. The patients responsibility will be displayed at the same time. The Vaccine Manager Help menu will provide an overview of contract terms by plan, but this information is general in nature and not specific to plan coverage.</p>

             <a class="acc-faq">What if I do not want to accept the amount to be paid, because I think it is too low?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>TransactRx has made every effort to assure contract rates (reimbursement to physicians) are at market, sufficient of cover the cost of the vaccine and provide a small profit for the physician. Participation in the network obligates physicians to accept this reimbursement for vaccines physicians administered to patients covered by payers contracted with TransactRx. If you do not find the reimbursement acceptable you can elect not to provide the vaccine, and cancel the claim. Paper claims submitted to contracted payers from either the patient or the provider will be reimbursed at the contract rate. Balance billing is prohibited.</p>

           </div>
           <div class="accordion-item">
             <a class="acc-faq">Can a provider administering a Part D vaccine charge the beneficiary a separate administration fee?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>Effective January 1, 2008, the administration of a Part D-covered vaccine is included in the definition of covered Part D drug under the Part D statute and is required to be billed as part of the Part D claims process.
                <br><br>
                Claims processed through TransactRx Vaccine Manager after December 31, 2007 will include the administration fee associated for vaccine submitted. The amount that will be paid for the vaccine and the administration fee will be provided.
                <br><br>
                What if my patient brings a vaccine from a retail or specialty pharmacy for me to administer, can I use Vaccine Manager to process the administration fee?
                <br><br>
                Industry standards for processing vaccine claims do not support electronic submission administration only claims. DSI is working with NCPDP (National Council for Prescription Drug Plans to identify a possible solution for administration only vaccine claims. Until a solution is identified administration only claims should be submitted to the Part D plan on a paper CMS 1500 form.</p>

           <div class="accordion-item">
             <a class="acc-faq">Why are some patient collect amounts (copayments/deductibles) so high?</a>
             <div class="answer">
               <p>Depending on the patient&rsquo;s benefit plan and where the patient falls in their deducible cycle or &ldquo;donut hole&rdquo; (a period with no benefit coverage) they could have an out of pocket responsibility of up to 100% of the allowable charge. This is most common at the beginning of the benefit year. Patients will need to meet this deductible regardless of where they receive their pharmacy services. Once the deductible is met most patients will only be responsible for a small co-payment.
              <br><br>
               For more information on deductibles and other out of pockets expense see Medicare Part D below.</p>

             <div class="answer">
               <p>Yes, claims processed through vaccine manager and the associated out of pocket costs are managed by the Part D payer in the same way they manage claims processed by a retail network pharmacy.</p>

            <div class="answer">

            <a class="acc-faq">What is the basic Medicare Part D coverage model?</a>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>The basic Part D plan is made up of four parts.
              <br><br>
              Part 1 - An initial deductible of $275.00. Some plans waive the deductible, but these same plans may have a higher monthly premium.
              <br><br>
              Part 2 - Beneficiaries are required to pay a co-payment or coinsurance for each prescription until the retail cost of the medications reaches $2,150. Some plans may lower the the limit to $2,000 or $1,850 which usually results in lower monthly premiums.
              <br><br>
              Part 3- Once the beneficiary reaches the coverage limit defined above, they enter into a coverage gap or &ldquo;donut hole&rdquo;. At this point beneficiaries are responsible for 100% of their medciation costs. Some plans provide partial or complete coverage for this gap in the Medicare Part D coverage.
              <br><br>
              Part 4 - Once a beneficiaries true out of pocket costs exceeds $4050 for prescription medications they enter into to the &ldquo;catastrophic coverage&rdquo; where the cost of medications is substantially reduced. The $4050 does not include the portion of prescription medications paid by the insurance company, nor does it included premiums paid by the beneficiary. Cost of medication during the catastrophic phase ranges between $2.25 for generics and the higher of 5% of the cost of the medication or $5.6 for brand medications.</p>

It includes all of the payments for medications listed on a plan&rsquo;s formulary that are purchased at a network/participating pharmacy.
